# OO is stupid

This project tries to demonstrate bad OO style. Sadly, some of the ideas shown here
I received during my education. I hope the style of OO demonstrated here is not
used in the software industry anymore, anywhere, these days.

The goal of this project is to lay an intentionally low baseline, to show how
OO could be abused if used without moderation.

As far as I understand, OO is a set of principles that define which concepts a
programming language must follow to qualify as an OO language, or how code should be
structured in order to be OO. Frequently used buzzwords are 'encapsulation',
'inheritance', 'messaging', and probably others.

Whereas the concept of OO started as academic, and is already quite old by today,
professional application often uses some guidelines or best practices that restrict
the wild usage of OO. The SOLID principles probably are the most famous.
